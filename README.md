    # - Natural language processing (NLP) for understanding the user's intent.
    # - Machine learning models for generating responses or performing tasks.
    # - Error correction mechanisms to refine the AI's output.

    # For this example, we'll simply echo the input with a message.

    # Add more advanced AI features here, such as:
    # - Summarization
    # - Translation
    # - Code generation
    # - Question answering
    # - etc.

    # Implement error correction mechanisms here. This could involve:
    # - Checking for grammatical errors.
    # - Identifying and correcting factual inaccuracies.
    # - Detecting and mitigating biases.
    # - Providing alternative responses if the initial response is unclear or irrelevant.

    # Note: This example lacks the actual AI logic and error correction mechanisms.
    # To build a real-world application, you would need to integrate specific AI models and techniques.
